LLM-001,Utah minor curfew system with ASL enforcement,yes,0.950,critical,"The Utah Social Media Regulation Act imposes specific requirements on social media platforms for users who are minors residing in Utah, including time-based access restrictions and parental control capabilities. These legal obligations are geographically limited to Utah residents and require age assurance (age-sensitive logic) combined with geo-location processing (geo-handler) to enforce the curfew between 10:30 PM and 6:00 AM only for minors physically located in Utah. This clearly mandates a geo-specific compliance logic to identify Utah residents and apply different rules accordingly. Additionally, parental override is a feature supported by the law. Although enforcement of some aspects is currently stayed, the law's requirements remain distinct to Utah and do not apply elsewhere, so geo-targeted implementation is necessary to meet legal compliance under Utah law.

LLM-002,California teen personalized feed controls,yes,0.950,critical,"The California SB976 law specifically regulates social media use by minors within California and imposes distinct requirements regarding personalized (algorithmic) feeds. It mandates default disabling of personalized algorithmic feeds for users under 18 in California, with explicit parental consent required to enable them. This necessitates geo-specific compliance logic to identify California users and apply SB976's parental consent and feed restriction requirements accordingly. The law also requires verified parental consent through a designated parental control system (e.g., Jellybean) and involves non-revocable 'not recommended' settings unless the opt-in is verified. Since similar laws (e.g., Florida HB3) have different restrictions that are geographically limited, each with distinct enforcement obligations, geo-targeted enforcement and precise age verification tied to location are critical for legal compliance. Furthermore, California’s Attorney General regulations forthcoming by 2027 will likely refine implementation, requiring the platform to maintain separate compliance mechanisms per jurisdiction. Therefore, the feature must implement geo-specific logic to comply with California SB976 and distinguish from other jurisdictions' rules or absence thereof.

LLM-003,CSAM detection and NCMEC reporting pipeline,yes,0.850,critical,"The feature—an automated CSAM detection and reporting system integrated with NCMEC reporting—is subject to U.S. federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. § 2258A, which mandates prompt reporting of known or suspected CSAM by providers. This federal obligation applies uniformly across U.S. jurisdictions, but because the platform operates globally (e.g., TikTok), geo-specific compliance logic is necessary to accommodate differing international laws and reporting requirements outside the U.S. Although the U.S. law requires automated detection and reporting of child sexual abuse material to NCMEC, other countries may have different or additional legal requirements regarding content scanning, data privacy, age verification methods, and reporting entities. These variations necessitate geo-targeted enforcement of compliance (e.g., enabling the NCMEC reporting pipeline only for users in the U.S.) and potentially different content moderation or user verification procedures elsewhere. Moreover, certain laws such as age verification requirements or expanded minor safety obligations (highlighted in related state or international legislation) may further require tailoring the system by region. Therefore, implementing geo-specific compliance logic minimizes legal risk, respects local privacy and surveillance laws, and ensures adherence to jurisdictionally distinct obligations.

LLM-004,EU DSA illegal content reporting mechanism,yes,0.900,high,"The EU Digital Services Act (DSA) establishes specific legal obligations for hosting service providers operating within the EU, including implementing a notice-and-action mechanism for illegal content reporting compliant with Article 24 and Article 25. These obligations require platforms to process reports of illegal content from EU users with transparency, timelines, and reporting mechanisms tailored to EU legal standards. Because the DSA is an EU regulation with jurisdiction limited to the European Union, compliance logic must be geo-specific to ensure that the reporting mechanism applies and functions according to EU law only for content and users within the EU. Additionally, the enforcement framework, transparency reporting, and risk assessments vary by jurisdiction—particularly for very large online platforms—and the platforms must interface with EU authorities differently than with authorities elsewhere. Therefore, the feature requires geo-specific compliance logic to apply DSA rules exclusively for EU users and content governed by EU jurisdiction, while other jurisdictions follow different or no equivalent requirements. This geo-targeting is a legal necessity to avoid non-compliance or overreach outside the EU, as well as to respect regional enforcement, data access, and transparency frameworks laid out by the DSA and its Articles 24, 25, and 28. The risk level is high given the significant fines and enforcement actions (up to 6% global turnover fines) associated with breaches of the DSA by major platforms.

LLM-005,Florida parental notification system,yes,0.950,high,"Florida's HB 3 (Online Protections for Minors) establishes **clear legal obligations that are geographically limited to the state of Florida** with specific provisions requiring social media platforms to implement parental controls and parental notification systems for minors in Florida. The law mandates age restrictions on account creation (under 14 prohibited, 14-15 require parental consent), account termination, and parental monitoring controls, including notification of account activity changes. It also imposes penalties for non-compliance specific to Florida residents. This creates a necessity for geo-specific compliance logic to differentiate Florida-based minor accounts and apply these regulatory requirements uniquely to them, notably the notification alerts to parents about privacy setting changes and contact from unknown users. The Jellybean parental control integration aligns with the law’s intent to empower parents. Furthermore, different states have distinct requirements (for example, California's SB 976 imposes different rules), underscoring the need for jurisdictional enforcement. Therefore, to avoid legal risk and implement controls effectively in Florida only, geo-targeting, age verification, and parental consent enforcement must be location-aware.

LLM-006,Creator monetization leaderboard,yes,0.850,high,"The creator monetization leaderboard is a feature that ranks content creators based on engagement metrics and ties into creator fund eligibility and payment systems, which inherently involves handling personal data and financial transactions. Data privacy regulations such as the GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), and other regional laws impose jurisdiction-specific requirements on the collection, processing, and transfer of personal data, as well as rules governing payments and eligibility criteria. Additionally, specific legal frameworks, including the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), require risk assessments and implementation of risk mitigation measures for very large online platforms, which often entails geo-targeted compliance measures. Given the involvement of personal data, payments, and potential protection of minors or vulnerable groups (common on social media platforms), the feature will likely need geo-specific compliance logic to fulfill requirements like explicit consent, age verification, and systemic risk mitigation that differ by jurisdiction. Moreover, advertising and financial compliance regulations vary globally and may affect eligibility requirements and disclosures related to monetization. Hence, geo-targeted implementation is needed to ensure lawful processing of data, respect local consumer protection, and conform to region-specific financial and privacy rules.",GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation); CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act); EU Digital Services Act (Articles 28 and 35); COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) where applicable; Other jurisdictional data privacy and financial transaction laws,EU DSA (relevance: 0.167)
LLM-007,Global autoplay optimization experiment,yes,0.850,high,"The feature involves testing different autoplay behaviors using machine learning models personalized per region, which implicates user engagement metrics and potentially impacts minors differently across geographies. Under the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), especially Articles 28 and 35, very large online platforms are required to perform risk assessments focused on the protection of minors, privacy, and systemic risks with a strong emphasis on geo-specific risk factors and tailoring measures accordingly. The EU guidelines stress age assurance, content exposure controls, and the use of age-appropriate design that vary by jurisdiction based on local laws and risks to minors. Given that autoplay optimization affects content consumption patterns, which can raise privacy, safety, and security concerns, especially for minors, geo-specific compliance logic is necessary to address different regulatory requirements, age verification standards, and systemic risk mitigation per jurisdiction. Failure to implement geo-specific compliance risks violating local laws such as the EU DSA and its child protection guidelines. Although some detailed enforcement may evolve, the necessity for geo-targeted risk evaluation and compliance measures is clear in the EU context and likely applicable globally due to varied laws concerning minors and privacy.",EU Digital Services Act (DSA) Article 28 - Risk assessment for very large online platforms; EU Digital Services Act (DSA) Article 35 - Additional risk mitigation measures for very large online platforms; EU Guidelines on Protection of Minors under the DSA,EU DSA (relevance: 0.197)
