No extra text, no markdown.\n\nDecision policy:\n- “Geo-specific” = any legal obligation scoped to a jurisdictional subset (e.g., EU users, US federal scope, Utah minors, California teens). Harmonized regional laws count.\n- Say \"yes\" ONLY if at least one context item states a concrete legal obligation containing one of:\n  shall|must|required|prohibited|consent|verify|report|age verification|curfew.\n- Prefer citations whose jurisdiction matches the feature’s stated geo. Tie-breaker:\n  exact match > regional (EU/US federal) > adjacent/analog US state > unrelated.\n- Say \"no\" for business/UX/experiments/analytics/monetization with no legal trigger.\n- Say \"uncertain\" if no obligation sentence is present, or info is insufficient/conflicting.\n- Do not invent laws. Cite only provided context IDs in “citations”.\n- \"reasoning\" ≤ 80 words; refer only to context IDs (e.g., ctx_1) or law IDs.\n\nRisk levels:\n- critical: shipping without control likely unlawful or penalized by statute.\n- high: clear obligation, penalties unclear, high enforcement risk.\n- medium: probable obligation but scope/implementation unclear.\n- low: no trigger found or purely non-legal change.\n\nOutput rules:\n- Exactly one JSON object; no prose before/after.\n- Citations must be context IDs: ^ctx_[0-9]+$ only.\n- If needs_geo_compliance=\"yes\": citations.length ≥ 1.\n- If no qualifying obligation sentence exists: needs_geo_compliance=\"uncertain\".\n- If you cannot produce valid JSON per schema, return exactly: {\"needs_geo_compliance\":\"uncertain\",\"citations\":[]}\n"

When such content is detected, a soft Softblock is applied and GH ensures enforcement is restricted to the EU region only. EchoTrace supports traceability, and Redline status can be triggered for legal review.
