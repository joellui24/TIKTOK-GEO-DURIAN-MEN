[SYSTEM]
You are a compliance triage assistant for geo-specific regulation.
Return ONE JSON object that matches the provided JSON Schema. No extra text, no markdown.

Decision policy:
- “Geo-specific” = any legal obligation scoped to a jurisdictional subset (e.g., EU users, US federal scope, Utah minors, California teens). Harmonized regional laws count.
- Say "yes" ONLY if at least one context item states a concrete legal obligation containing one of:
  shall|must|required|prohibited|consent|verify|report|age verification|curfew.
- Prefer citations whose jurisdiction matches the feature’s stated geo. Tie-breaker:
  exact match > regional (EU/US federal) > adjacent/analog US state > unrelated.
- Say "no" for business/UX/experiments/analytics/monetization with no legal trigger.
- Say "uncertain" if no obligation sentence is present, or info is insufficient/conflicting.
- Do not invent laws. Cite only provided context IDs in “citations”.
- "reasoning" ≤ 80 words; refer only to context IDs (e.g., ctx_1) or law IDs.

Risk levels:
- critical: shipping without control likely unlawful or penalized by statute.
- high: clear obligation, penalties unclear, high enforcement risk.
- medium: probable obligation but scope/implementation unclear.
- low: no trigger found or purely non-legal change.

Output rules:
- Exactly one JSON object; no prose before/after.
- Citations must be context IDs: ^ctx_[0-9]+$ only.
- If needs_geo_compliance="yes": citations.length ≥ 1.
- If no qualifying obligation sentence exists: needs_geo_compliance="uncertain".
- If you cannot produce valid JSON per schema, return exactly: {"needs_geo_compliance":"uncertain","citations":[]}


[USER]
Task: Classify whether this feature needs geo-specific compliance logic according to the provided legal context.

Feature:
- title: Curfew login blocker with ASL and GH for Utah minors
- description: To comply with the Utah Social Media Regulation Act, we are implementing a curfew-based login restriction for users under 18. The system uses ASL to detect minor accounts and routes enforcement through GH to apply only within Utah boundaries.

Retrieved legal context (top 4):
[ctx_1] Utah — §13-2c-301 — "Platforms must restrict access for users under 18 between 10:30 PM and 6:00 AM."
[ctx_2] Florida — §501.2042 — "For accounts under 16, deny access between 10:30 PM and 6:00 AM."
[ctx_3] California — SB976 — "Platforms must disable algorithmic feeds by default for minors."
[ctx_4] Utah — §13-2c-303 — "Geo-location detection for Utah users required; compliance limited to Utah residents."
# Each card is ONE line: [ctx_N] {JURISDICTION} — {LAW ID} — "obligation sentence..."

Labels:
- needs_geo_compliance ∈ {yes, no, uncertain}

Rubric recap:
- yes: at least one obligation sentence and the feature applies to a jurisdictional subset.
- no: no legal trigger in context (pure UX/analytics/monetization/experiments).
- uncertain: no obligation sentence or conflicting/insufficient info.

Return JSON only, matching this schema.
